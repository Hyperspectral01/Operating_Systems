## 📂 **Repository Structure**  

The repository is organized into two main folders:  

1️⃣ **Bash Scripting**:  
   - Contains practicals **1–8** focused on shell scripting fundamentals.  
   - Learn how to work with UNIX commands, filters, basic calculators, file management, and more.  

2️⃣ **Multithreading**:  
   - Includes practicals **9–10**, exploring system calls and thread management using **C** and the **pthread library**.
